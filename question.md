# Answers to Technical Questions

## How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately 2-3 hours on the coding test. This time was utilized for setting up the React application, creating the components, implementing the core functionalities, and testing the application to ensure everything works as expected.

## What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

One of the most useful features added to the latest version of JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) is the introduction of arrow functions. Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax and lexical scoping of the `this` keyword. This feature simplifies the syntax and avoids common pitfalls with the `this` context in traditional function expressions.

Here's a snippet of code that shows how I've used arrow functions in the Task Management application:


<!-- const TaskForm = ({ addTask }) => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
  const [description, setDescription] = useState('');
  const [dueDate, setDueDate] = useState('');
  const [priority, setPriority] = useState('Low');

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const newTask = {
      id: Date.now(),
      title,
      description,
      dueDate,
      priority,
      status: 'upcoming'
    };
    addTask(newTask);
    setTitle('');
    setDescription('');
    setDueDate('');
    setPriority('Low');
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Title"
        value={title}
        onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)}
        required
      />
      <textarea
        placeholder="Description"
        value={description}
        onChange={(e) => setDescription(e.target.value)}
        required
      ></textarea>
      <input
        type="date"
        value={dueDate}
        onChange={(e) => setDueDate(e.target.value)}
        required
      />
      <select value={priority} onChange={(e) => setPriority(e.target.value)}>
        <option value="High">High</option>
        <option value="Medium">Medium</option>
        <option value="Low">Low</option>
      </select>
      <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
    </form>
  );
}; -->


How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Tracking down a performance issue in production typically involves several steps:

Monitoring and Logging: Use monitoring tools (like New Relic, Datadog, or AWS CloudWatch) and logging (using tools like ELK stack) to identify performance bottlenecks and errors.
Profiling: Profile the application using built-in browser tools or server-side profiling tools to identify slow-running functions or memory leaks.
Analyzing Metrics: Analyze metrics such as response times, CPU and memory usage, and database query performance to pinpoint the issue.
Reproducing the Issue: Try to reproduce the issue in a staging environment with similar conditions to understand the root cause.
Optimizing Code: Based on the findings, optimize the code, database queries, or server configurations to improve performance.
Testing: Test the changes in a staging environment before deploying to production.
Yes, I have had to track down performance issues in production before. In one instance, we identified a performance bottleneck caused by inefficient database queries. By adding appropriate indexes and optimizing the queries, we were able to significantly improve the application's performance.

If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features and improvements to the task management application:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own tasks.
Persistent Storage: Use a backend server and database (e.g., Node.js with MongoDB) to persist tasks across sessions.
Notifications and Reminders: Add email or in-app notifications and reminders for upcoming and overdue tasks.
Drag-and-Drop Interface: Implement a drag-and-drop interface to easily reorder tasks or move them between sections.
Improved UI/UX: Enhance the user interface with better styling and responsive design using a library like Material-UI or Bootstrap.
Advanced Filtering: Add more advanced filtering options, such as filtering by date range or combining multiple filters.
Task Categories: Allow users to categorize tasks into different projects or categories for better organization.
